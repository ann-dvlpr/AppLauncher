<h1>Why AppLauncher was created?</h1>
I love CLIs, Terminals and, I am now using Termux as my launcher. I didnt liked the GUI to start apps (App i used for that is SmartDock) so... I did my own launcher.

<var>AppLaunch -h</var> - launch an app (w/activity) from history
<var>AppLaunch -d history</var> - clears the history fild
